  lessonText: "There are three ways that a nascent cult can fall apart. \n\nIf you
    no longer have any followers, you no longer have a cult.\n\nIf your plans are
    discovered before the ritual completes, your cult will be uncovered and scatter.
    Keep the Obscurity Meter full. \n\nIf your faith ever falters, the ancient gods
    will never forgive you. Never let your Faith Meter run out. "
