  lessonTitle: Cultist Happiness
  lessonText: "It is difficult to toil and keep the faith. Your cultists will express
    their pleasure or displeasure on their face. \n\nWorried cultists could leave
    your cult at any time. They have strange effects on your progress when put to
    work. \n\nUnsure cultists are just not as productive as they should be. \n\nHappy
    cultists really help you move forward. \n\nZealous go the extra mile, which means
    that they can draw attention to your cult faster than others too. "
