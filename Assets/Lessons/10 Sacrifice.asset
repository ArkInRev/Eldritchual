  lessonTitle: Sacrificing for the Old Horrors
  lessonText: "This little bit is the secret of the cult that only you know. \n\nYou're
    going to toss those little followers into a pit and sacrifice them to your dark
    master. The happier the cultist, the better the offering. You will make ritual
    progress when you do, but if you don't keep the ritual moving, you will gradually
    lose progress. Worried cultists will set you back, so be careful. \n\nDon't upset
    a diety. Sacrifice your beloved followers. "
