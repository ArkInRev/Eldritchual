  lessonTitle: Worship the Eldritch Horrors
  lessonText: "Faith is the best way to maintain your ritual progress. One very good
    way to gain faith is to worship at the shrine. \n\nCultists love to please their
    dark masters, it's just not as great as having some time off from their toils.
    \n\nThe people of the town sometimes hear the late night chanting, so be careful
    not to overdo it. "
