  lessonTitle: Cultists Need some Relaxation
  lessonText: "Weary cultists need to have a break to relax and be reinvigorated.
    \n\nWhile doing nothing productive is a drain on your cult as a whole, it helps
    to have a little bit of fun. It may even entice new recruits. \n\nBe careful with
    worried cultists though. Tough love is the only way to turn their frowns upside
    down. "
