  lessonTitle: Recruit More Followers
  lessonText: "As your cultists prosthelytize in the streets, and as word of your
    cult gets out to the public, you will attract new followers into your fold. \n\nUnfortunately,
    it's difficult to find converts and cult members generally dislike the activity.
    \n\nShouting on the streets does also attract some attention that will reduce
    your obscurity. "
