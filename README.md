# Eldritchual
A game originally written for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43) 43 Compo event. This is my first game entry and the source files were initially submitted via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xBfX_8QwdnBngTY1ZvmeFdOyRCEKi9Ep). The goal is to make the source code more accessible and to address some of the issues identified in the event to improve this small project.
